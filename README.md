# Neural-Network
Learning Neural Network from Raw 

## Input Layer 

Dimensions of vectors that was input to the program.

## Hidden Layer 

Represents the intermediate nodes that partition the input space into areas with boundaries. \n It does this by receiving a set of weighted input and then producing output using an activation function.

## Output Layer 

Represents the result of Neural Network's Processing
